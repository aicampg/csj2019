## FAQ
### Why use Incognito Window and How to start
* Incognito window will give you a clean start on running labs. The lab has mulitple systems, multiple accounts and websites to work on. A clean start will help you to avoid many mysterious errors. So we recommend to close all windows/tabs after you done with the lab. To start a new lab, re-run the lab, just open a new incognito window. 
* Another reason: during the labs, the lab will generate new username/pwd to logon to google cloud, which will LOGOUT your existing google logos if any such as gmail, gdrive, etc...) which is really annoying.
* To start the Incognito Window, on chrome browser, go to 'File' menu and click 'New Incognito Window'
