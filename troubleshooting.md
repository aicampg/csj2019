# Google Cloud Study Jam Instructions

## Before the event:
We’ll use a tool called Qwiklabs, a Google training product. If you’ve used Qwiklabs before, great! Make sure you know your password. If you haven’t, save time by creating a new Qwiklabs account for yourself prior to the class at: https://google.qwiklabs.com/users/sign_up(creating an account is free). 

## During the event
### Get monthly subscription
Many code labs on Qwiklab are actually paid courses, you need to buy credits and then use credit to pay for the courses you want to learn. The Cloud Study Jam event makes these courses free to learn by giving you monthly subscription. With the monthly subscription, you can learn all courses for free within the month.
At the event, we’ll give you a link and token for free Qwiklabs access. Make sure you check the opt-in box for promos, especially because that makes you eligible for additional free access after you complete the first series of labs.
Suprisely it's not very easy to get monthly subscription. but the idea is that with access code, you will get 1 credit to do the first code lab (which cost 1 credit). after you are done with the first code lab, you will get one month subscription.
