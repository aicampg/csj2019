# Google Cloud Study Jam Instructions

## Before the event:
We’ll use a tool called Qwiklabs, a Google training product. If you’ve used Qwiklabs before, great! Make sure you know your password. If you haven’t, save time by creating a new Qwiklabs account for yourself prior to the class at: [Qwiklab](https://google.qwiklabs.com/users/sign_up). (creating an account is free). 

## During the event
### Get monthly subscription
Many code labs on Qwiklab are actually paid courses, you need to buy credits and then use credit to pay for the courses you want to learn. The Cloud Study Jam event makes these courses free to learn by giving you monthly subscription. With the monthly subscription, you can learn all courses for free within the month.
At the event, we’ll give you a link and token for free Qwiklabs access. Make sure you check the opt-in box for promos, especially because that makes you eligible for additional free access after you complete the first series of labs.

Suprisely it's not very easy step to get monthly subscription. but the idea is that with access code, you will get 1 credit to do the first code lab (which costs 1 credit). after you are done with the first code lab, you will get one month subscription. 
Follow the steps to get monthly subscription:
1. Sign out from qwiklab
2. Go to landing page: http://bit.ly/ML-StudyJam
3. Select the quest to enroll, (Your organizer chosen the quest, for example: Language processing study jam)
4. Enter Access code. (Your organizer have the access code, for example: <1s-seattle-1234>. note: the code works only on the event date. also double check NO typo in the access code).  
5. Sign in qwiklab with your account
6. Click: Enroll to this quest, this will goes to the first code lab. 
7. Click ‘start lab’ button and choose "launch with 1 credit" option in the popup window
8. work on and complete the lab. When you done, END the lab
9. Go to your profile page, and refresh. You should see you have the monthly subscription. If not, try to logout/logon again.
10. For the next lab or future code labs, use ‘use subscription’ option when start the lab

If you have trouble to get 1 credit to start the first code lab, try these:
* Repeat the steps 1~6 a few times. sometimes, it just works.
* On step 6, if you already enrolled, you can unenroll and reenroll.  
* when you sign out from qwiklab, make sure close all other tabs too. 
* try to use the incognito window 
* on Step 9, sometimes, it takes a few minutes to show monthly subscription, so wait a few minutes. if doesn't work, logout and login to see.
* on Step 8, if you didn't complete the lab or time out, it's ok. you still can move on to step 9 to get monthly subscription. 
* If try all kinds of ways but still can't get 1 credit or monthly subscription, ask your organizer to share credit with you (each organizer has 200 credits) to unblock you.

### Work on the first code lab
* After code lab starts, the timer will start. You have one hour to complete all steps of this lab.  Note:
  - Once the clock starts, you can not pause or stop the clock
  - You can rerun the lab again and again, but every time you restart the lab, you will start over again.
* Follow the steps in the lab
* Make sure to read all instructions CAREFULLY
